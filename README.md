Travel Insurance Data 

## Context :
Travel insurance is a type of insurance that provides protection as long as we travel both domestically and abroad. Several countries have even required travelers to have travel insurance, for example, countries in Europe and America. The amount of premium depends on the coverage desired, the length of the trip, and the purpose of the trip. A company engaged in travel insurance wants to know the policyholder who will submit an insurance claim for coverage. Policyholder data at insurance companies is historical data consisting of destinations, insurance products, and so on.
